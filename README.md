# Dependencies

* python3
* python3-requests
* python3-jinja2
* systemd

# Install

## Current Method

Copy all the systemd service files (`mirrors-index.service`, `mirrors-index.timer`,
`mirrors-index.path`) from `services/` dir into `/etc/systemd/system/`.
Then enable them and start the timer and the path file.

## Previous Method

The following method is obsolete, because /srv/www only contains symlinks.

Add a following line to incrontab:

```/srv/www IN_CREATE,IN_DELETE,IN_MOVE /home/mirror/newindex/genindex.py```

The crontab file was also used to trigger the update based on time before.
Use `crontab -l -u mirror` to check the line that has been commented out for now.

## Locales

Install zh_CN locales since the `genisolist.ini` file contains Chinese characters.
